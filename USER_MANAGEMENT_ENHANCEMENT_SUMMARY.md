# User Management Enhancement - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced UserFormPage.jsx

- **Single Location Mode**: When a restaurant has only one location, the interface now shows:

  - A prominent location info box showing which location will be used
  - Multiple role selection via checkboxes instead of individual role-location pairs
  - All selected roles automatically assigned to the single location
  - Cleaner, more intuitive UI

- **Multi-Location Mode**: For restaurants with multiple locations, keeps the original:
  - Role-location pairs system
  - Individual location selection for each role
  - Add/remove role-location pairs functionality

### 2. New Function: toggleRoleForSingleLocation()

- Handles adding/removing roles in single location mode
- Automatically assigns all roles to the restaurant's single location
- Updates the role_location_pairs data structure correctly

### 3. Enhanced SCSS Styling

- New `.single-location-mode` styles
- Location info box with blue theme
- Role checkbox styling with hover effects
- Professional card-like role selection interface

   - ✅ Original role-location pairs interface
   - ✅ "Add/Remove Profile" buttons
   - ✅ Location selection for each role

### Step 3: Create Test Users

1. **Single Location**: Select multiple roles (e.g., Manager, Waiter, Cashier)
2. **Multi-Location**: Create different role-location combinations
