🚀 USER MANAGEMENT ENHANCEMENT TEST GUIDE
==========================================

The user management system has been enhanced with the following features:

1. 📍 SINGLE LOCATION MODE:
   - When a restaurant has only ONE location
   - Shows the location name prominently
   - Allows selecting MULTIPLE roles via checkboxes
   - All selected roles are automatically assigned to the single location
   - Provides a cleaner, more intuitive interface

2. 🏢 MULTI-LOCATION MODE:
   - When a restaurant has multiple locations
   - Uses the original role-location pairs system
   - Each role can be assigned to specific locations
   - Allows complex role-location combinations

🧪 TESTING STEPS:
================

STEP 1: Test Single Location Restaurant
--------------------------------------
1. Login as: flavio_luiz_ferreira@hotmail.com (pw: 12345678)
2. Navigate to Admin > Users > Create New User
3. You should see:
   - Location info box showing "Unidade: [Location Name]"
   - Role selection as checkboxes instead of dropdowns
   - Ability to select multiple roles
   - No location selection (automatic assignment)

STEP 2: Test Multi-Location Restaurant
-------------------------------------
1. Login as: flavio_luiz_ferreira_chain@hotmail.com (pw: 12345678)
2. Navigate to Admin > Users > Create New User
3. You should see:
   - Original role-location pairs interface
   - Ability to add multiple role-location pairs
   - Location selection for each role

STEP 3: Create Test Users
------------------------
For both restaurants, create users with:
- Multiple roles (single location mode)
- Different role-location combinations (multi-location mode)
- Verify the role assignments are saved correctly

🎯 EXPECTED RESULTS:
===================
✅ Single location restaurants show simplified multi-role selection
✅ Multi-location restaurants show original detailed interface
✅ Role assignments are saved correctly in both modes
✅ UI is intuitive and user-friendly
