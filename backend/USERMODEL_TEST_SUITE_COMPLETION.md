- ✅ BaseModel method mocking (`find`, `findById`, `validate`, `executeQuery`, etc.)
- ✅ Database connection mocking
- ✅ Logger mocking for clean test output
- ✅ Crypto module mocking for deterministic testing

### Test Data Management

- ✅ Consistent test user fixtures
- ✅ Dynamic UUID generation for isolation
- ✅ Restaurant relationship test data
- ✅ Edge case data scenarios

## 🚀 Quality Assurance Features

### Code Quality

- ✅ No test code duplication
- ✅ Clear test descriptions and organization
- ✅ Comprehensive error scenarios
- ✅ Realistic test data
- ✅ Proper cleanup and isolation

### Coverage Analysis

The following UserModel methods achieved full test coverage:

- `create()` - User creation with validation
- `findById()` - User retrieval by ID
- `findByEmail()` - User search by email
- `findByUsername()` - User search by username
- `authenticate()` - User authentication
- `update()` - User updates with constraints
- `deleteUser()` - Soft deletion
- `confirmEmail()` - Email confirmation
- `changePassword()` - Password updates
- `checkRestaurantExists()` - Restaurant validation
- `getUsersByRestaurant()` - Restaurant filtering
- `hashPassword()` - Password security
- `verifyPassword()` - Password verification
- `generateEmailConfirmationToken()` - Token generation
- `generatePasswordResetToken()` - Reset tokens

### Uncovered Areas

The small percentage of uncovered code consists of:

- Error handling edge cases in BaseModel inheritance
- Some logging statements in error branches
- Defensive validation checks for extremely rare scenarios

These uncovered areas represent non-critical paths and defensive programming patterns.
