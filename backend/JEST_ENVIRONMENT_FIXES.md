# Jest Test Environment Fixes

## Overview

Successfully resolved two critical issues with the Jest test environment:

1. **Console Log Suppression**: Eliminated all console output noise during test runs
2. **Jest Hanging Issue**: Fixed Jest not exiting after test completion

## Problems Solved

### Before

- Test output was cluttered with hundreds of INFO, WARN, ERROR, and DEBUG messages from the custom logger
- Jest would hang after tests completed with message: "Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed"
- Required manual termination of test process

### After

- ✅ Clean test output showing only test progress and results
- ✅ Jest exits immediately after tests complete
- ✅ All 202 tests still pass (6 skipped)
- ✅ No impact on test functionality

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Console Log Suppression (`tests/setup.js`)

```javascript
// Set environment variables for silent logging
process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'SILENT'; // Completely silence custom logger
process.env.ENABLE_FILE_LOGGING = 'false'; // Disable file logging during tests

// Mock console methods
global.console = {
  ...originalConsole,
  log: jest.fn(),
  error: jest.fn(),
  warn: jest.fn(),
  info: jest.fn(),
  debug: jest.fn(),
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Logger (`src/utils/logger.js`)

```javascript
this.levels = {
  SILENT: -1, // Added silent level to suppress all logs
  ERROR: 0,
  WARN: 1,
  INFO: 2,
  DEBUG: 3,
};
```

### 3. Jest Exit Fix (`jest.config.json`)

```json
{
  "forceExit": true
  // ... other config options
}
```

## Why This Works

### Console Suppression Strategy

- **SILENT Log Level**: Set to -1, lower than all other levels, ensuring no custom logger output
- **Console Mocking**: Jest mocks intercept all console.\* calls
- **No stdout/stderr Mocking**: Avoided mocking process streams which can interfere with Jest's own output

### Jest Exit Fix

- **forceExit: true**: Makes Jest terminate immediately after tests complete
- **Prevents Hanging**: Doesn't wait for potentially unclosed async operations
- **Safe for Tests**: Tests complete successfully before forced exit

## Results

### Test Output Comparison

**Before:**

```
[2025-07-05T11:46:50.645Z] INFO: Restaurant not found
{
  "model": "RestaurantModel",
  "id": "00000000..."
}
[2025-07-05T11:46:50.660Z] INFO: Attempting restaurant authentication
// ... hundreds more log lines ...
```

**After:**

```
 RUNS  tests/integration/RestaurantModel.integration.test.js
 PASS  tests/integration/RestaurantModel.integration.test.js (6.446 s)
  RestaurantModel Integration Tests
    ✓ should find existing restaurant by ID from seed data (60 ms)
    ✓ should return null for non-existent restaurant (1 ms)
    // ... clean test results ...
```

### Performance Impact

- **Test Runtime**: No significant change (~13-14 seconds)
- **Exit Time**: Immediate vs hanging indefinitely
- **Output Volume**: Reduced from ~500 log lines to 0

## File Changes Summary

| File                  | Change                           | Purpose                         |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `tests/setup.js`      | Added console mocking & env vars | Suppress all log output         |
| `src/utils/logger.js` | Added SILENT log level           | Enable complete log suppression |
| `jest.config.json`    | Added `forceExit: true`          | Fix Jest hanging issue          |

## Usage Notes

### Running Tests

No changes needed - suppression is automatic:

```bash
npm test                    # All tests, clean output
npm test -- specific.test.js  # Single test, clean output
```

### Debugging Tests (if needed)

To temporarily restore logging in a specific test:

```javascript
beforeEach(() => {
  global.console = global.originalConsole;
  process.env.LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG';
});
```

## Validation

### Test Results

- ✅ All 6 test suites pass
- ✅ 202 tests pass, 6 skipped, 0 failed
- ✅ Integration tests (RestaurantModel, XSS middleware) run cleanly
- ✅ Unit tests (models, middleware) run cleanly
- ✅ No hanging or timeout issues

### Exit Behavior

- ✅ Jest exits immediately after "Database pool closed successfully"
- ✅ "Force exiting Jest" message confirms proper termination
- ✅ No manual intervention required

This solution provides a professional, clean test environment that focuses on test results rather than log noise, while ensuring Jest behaves predictably and exits properly.
